They are minimal examples of what Shiny is capable of.\n\nUse the same project for both exercises.\n\n# Exercise 1\n\n1.1 Create a project (refer back to the notes in the RMarkdown section of the course if necessary) containing both a ui.R and server.R file, you may find it useful to use the template files provided to you.\n\n1.2 If you followed along with the instructors live-coding example, use the code from there. Otherwise you will need to add the following to your files:\n\nui:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}\nplotOutput(\"curvePlot\")\n```\n\nserver:\n\n```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}\noutput$curvePlot <- renderPlot({\n    curve(x,\n          from = -5,\n          to = 5)\n  })\n```\n\n1.3 Add a `sliderInput` to the ui that will allow users to change a value from 1 to 5, with a default value of 3. Refer to the documentation or http://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/latest/ as necessary.\n\n1.4 Modify the server so that the curve(x^slider) is generated\n\n1.5 Run the app and ensure it works.\n\n# Exercise 2\n\n2.1 Add a control to the Shiny app you built before that allows you to type your name\n\n2.2 Use the \"main\" argument of `curve` to provide your name as the title of the plot\n\n2.3 Use the paste function to combine the your name with the current value of the exponent, for instance: \"Plot of x^4 (by Johanna Smith)\"\n\n```{r, eval=F,echo=TRUE}\npaste(\"this\", \"that\")\n```\n\n",
